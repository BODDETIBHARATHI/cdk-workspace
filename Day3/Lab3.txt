Lab 3 - queue (algorithm/flow
Queue ( c++ -> flow of program)
	Array
		-> enqueue/add -> push an element in queue
		-> dequeue/poll -> pull an element from queue
    
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
 Queue [ FIFO ]{
    1) intialize front and rear end as 0, declare size of the queue.
    2) Make the front and rear end pointing towards the first position of queue. 
    3) Enqueue --->
         a) If the size of the queue ia same as rear end then display queue is full
         b) else insert the element into the queue and increament the rear end
    4) Dequeue --->
         a) if front and rear are equal then display queue as empty
         b) else increment the front end so now the queue will now longer contain that element.
 
 }
