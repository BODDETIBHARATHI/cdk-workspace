  Binary Tree
         -> Sequential access as traversing is donw from root.
         -> Dynamic allocation as it is similar to linked list.
         -> In order to place a value we have to traverse from root to that specific node where we want to insert the element and for getting a node value we have to traverse from root to that node using links.
         -> File directory, hierarchial structures.
